# Ages of Life

### About

Ages of Life game is a game, where you lead your civilization through ages. In time you
will meet other civilizations that can be either your friend or your enemy. The game is
not about conquering the land. It's about progress. The faster you develop technologies,
the better you are. War is (or will be) one of the game mechanics, but it will not be
the main part.

### Code

As you might have noticed, the project is open source. As written in the license, you cannot
use images or sounds, but you are allowed to use the code for any purpose. There is a line
in the license: "The code cannot be used as a whole.". It simply means, that you cannot just
copy the whole game. If you have any suggestions about code improvement, please also post them.

### Support
You can support us using the sponsor button. Our goal is to put the game on Steam (still free
to play), but it would cost us 100 USD and this is a 0-budget game.
